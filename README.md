# Movie-Recommender-System-With-Streamlit.
In This Project I am going to build a movie recommendation system project and then build a model and then build an app using streamlit.
There are three main types of recommendation engines that are used here: collaborative filtering, content-based filtering – and a hybrid of the two. 

Collaborative filtering focuses on collecting and analyzing data on user behavior, activities, and preferences, to predict what a person will like, based on their similarity to other users.

Content-based filtering works on the principle that if you like a particular item, you will also like this other item. To make recommendations, algorithms use a profile of the customer’s preferences and a description of an item (genre, product type, color, word length) to work out the similarity of items using cosine and Euclidean distances.  
The downside of content-based filtering is that the system is limited to recommending products or content similar to what the person is already buying or using. It can’t go beyond this to recommend other types of products or content. For example, it couldn’t recommend products beyond homeware if the customer had only brought homeware.



## Project Work Flow :

### Step 1: Data collection.
### Step 2: Preprocessing Our Data.
### Step 3: Building the Model for prediction.
### Step 4: Making it on web app with the help of streamlit
